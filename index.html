                    <h2>Time Management</h2>
                    <p class="transform-capitalize">Time management is the coordination of tasks and activities to maximize the effectiveness of an individual's efforts. Essentially, the purpose of time management is to enable people to get more and better work done in less time.</p>
                    <p class="transform-capitalize">Elements of time management include organization, planning, and scheduling to best take advantage of the time available. Time management techniques also take into account an individual's particular situation and their relevant capabilities.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
                    <p class="transform-capitalize">Problem solving is one of the important points that must be understood in a company or organization. There are various kinds of individuals in various divisions, so that conflicts and problems can arise at any time. Problem solving is a method that helps someone understand how to solve problems optimally.</p>
                    <p class="transform-capitalize">This is one of the important soft skills needed by someone, including employees in the company. Especially for a leader and manager in almost every profession, this ability is very useful when one has to make decisions when faced with difficult and useless situations and problems in the workplace.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>Leadership</h2>
                    <p class="transform-capitalize">Leadership is a set of behaviors used to help people align their collective direction, execute strategic plans, and continually renew an organization.</p>
                    <br>Leaders, to a certain degree, do the same thing. Whether you’re talking about an executive, manager, sports coach, or schoolteacher, leadership is about guiding and impacting outcomes, enabling groups of people to work together to accomplish what they couldn’t do working individually. In this sense, leadership is something you do, not something you are. Some people in formal leadership positions are poor leaders, and many people exercising leadership have no formal authority. It is their actions, not their words, that inspire trust and energy.</br>
                    <h2>Event Organizer</h2>
                    <p class="transform-capitalize">An event organiser is a business or individual that undertakes the beginning-to-end production of your event.</p>
                    <p class="transform-capitalize">Event organisers work for clients across all kinds of industries, for all kinds of events. This includes conferences, corporate events, award ceremonies, product launches, and theatre productions.</p>
